link: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview
### This repository contains the code and model used for the Kaggle "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques" competition. The goal of the competition is to predict the sales price for each house based on various features, such as house characteristics, neighborhood, and construction quality.

## Rank and Score
* Final Score: 0.12567 (Root Mean Squared Log Error)
* Rank: 525th out of 4700 participants

## Project Overview
This project leverages machine learning algorithms to predict house prices based on a dataset of 79 explanatory variables describing aspects of residential homes. The final model achieves a competitive RMSE (Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error) by employing feature engineering and an ensemble method, Gradient Boosting Regressor.
